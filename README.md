### 2024 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space


This design is inspired by the game snake. I want the scene to start empty and then slowly fill up with lines (snakes) going around the space and filling it up.

In terms of concrete performance, I'd like to have different depths, so some lines are "closer" to the screen and others are more pushed back in the background, so varying shapes as well. If possible I may look into making the animation appear 3D so the snake is coming towards the screen and vice versa.

An inspiration that has been brought to my attention is the 3D pipes screensaver, which looks similar to what I had in mind.

In terms of color, I'm not set one style in particular. Maybe lots of colors with big contrast or just plain colors with a gradient from dark to light.
